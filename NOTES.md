+ React / Redux
  + Action Creators
  + Provider
  + connect
  + MapStateToProps
  + combineReducers
+ React Router

## To-Dos:
1. Create a store
2. Have a property on our state called 'cats' that points to an array of all of the cats
3. Have an action with the type of 'FETCH_CATS' that will load up all of the cats
4. Connect that property into the Cats Index component so it can list out all of the pretty cats

# Step 1:
 + npm install --save react-router
 + update index.js w/ Router import

# Step 2.
 + npm install --save redux
 + npm install --save react-redux (?)
 + add "import {createStore} from 'redux';" (index.js)
